# Image Retrieval Project

This repository contains two Google Colab notebooks showcasing different techniques for image retrieval. The project focuses on comparing a baseline approach with the utilization of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model.

## Notebooks

- [Baseline Image Retrieval](image_retrieval_baseline.ipynb): Implementing a basic image retrieval method.
- [Image Retrieval using ViT](image_retrieval_using_vit.ipynb): Demonstrating image retrieval using the Vision Transformer (ViT) model.

## About

In the field of computer vision, image retrieval plays a crucial role in various applications. This project explores and contrasts two different techniques for image retrieval, providing insights into their respective performances and potential use cases.
